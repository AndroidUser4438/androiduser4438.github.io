# Welcome to my site!

I am a developer with knowledge in **Flutter** and **Python**. I am also quite familiar with Linux and ethical hacking.

I am working on a few mobile apps and will put the links here when they are done.

I have made a handy little [ethical hacking cheat sheet](androiduser4438.github.io/ethical_hacking_cheat_sheet) for anyone to use!
